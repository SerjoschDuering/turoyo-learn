# Turoyo Language Overview

## What is Turoyo?

Turoyo (ṬUR-oy-o), also called **Surayt** or **Suryoyo**, is a living Neo-Aramaic language. It belongs to the Central Neo-Aramaic branch of the Semitic language family. The name comes from the word **ṭuro** ("mountain"), referring to the Tur Abdin region ("Mountain of God's Servants") in southeastern Turkey where it originated.

Native speakers typically call their language **Suryoyo** ("Syriac/the way Syrians speak"). The academic term **Turoyo** distinguishes it from other Aramaic varieties. **Surayt** is the most widely used self-designation in modern standardization efforts.

### Relation to Other Aramaic Varieties

- **Classical Syriac (Kthobonoyo)**: The liturgical language of Syriac churches. Turoyo descended from Late Aramaic dialects alongside Classical Syriac but diverged as a distinct spoken variety between the 5th-7th centuries CE.
- **Suret (Northeastern Neo-Aramaic)**: Spoken by Assyrian/Chaldean communities. Shares some mutual intelligibility with Turoyo but is a distinct language.
- **Western Neo-Aramaic**: Spoken in Maaloula, Syria. NOT mutually intelligible with Turoyo despite both being "Aramaic."
- **Mlahso**: Turoyo's closest relative. Was spoken near Diyarbakir before 1915; last speakers recorded in Qamishli, Syria in the 1990s. Now nearly extinct.

## Writing Systems

### 1. Serto Script (Syriac)

Turoyo traditionally uses the **Serto** (Western Syriac) variant of the Syriac script. This is the script associated with the Syriac Orthodox tradition. Key features:
- Written right-to-left
- 22 consonant letters
- Vowels indicated by diacritical marks (dots and small marks above/below letters)
- Used since the 16th century for Turoyo texts
- Still used in religious and cultural contexts

### 2. Latin Script (Standardized)

A Latin-based orthography was first developed in the 1970s by **Yusuf Ishaq** in Sweden, responding to the Swedish government's policy that every child be educated in their first language. **Silas Uzel** independently created another Latin alphabet for Turoyo in Germany.

The orthography was **standardized at the International Surayt Conference** held at the University of Cambridge (27-30 August 2015), as part of the **Erasmus+ Aramaic-Online Project** (2014-2017). This standard uses 26 Latin letters plus diacritics for specific sounds.

**For the learning app**: Both scripts should be supported. Latin script is the primary interface for younger diaspora learners, with Serto as an optional/advanced feature.

## Speaker Demographics

| Region | Estimated Speakers | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Tur Abdin (Turkey) | ~1,500 | Remaining original homeland speakers |
| Syria (Qamishli, Hassaka) | Declining | Conflict-affected |
| Sweden | Tens of thousands | Largest diaspora, Latin script developed here |
| Germany | Tens of thousands | Second-largest diaspora |
| Netherlands | Thousands | Significant community |
| Switzerland | Thousands | Growing community |
| Belgium | Hundreds-Thousands | |
| France (Paris, Lyon) | Hundreds-Thousands | |
| Denmark | Hundreds-Thousands | |
| USA (New Jersey) | ~5,800 | Smaller diaspora |
| **Total worldwide** | **50,000 - 250,000** | UNESCO / various estimates |

### Migration History

Many Turoyo speakers first emigrated to **Syria and Lebanon** during upheavals in the early 20th century (including the Seyfo genocide of 1915). From the 1960s-1980s, many migrated to **Germany** as Gastarbeiter (guest workers), and subsequently many moved to **Sweden**. Today the diaspora vastly outnumbers homeland speakers.

## Language Status

- **UNESCO classification**: Severely Endangered (level 3 on 5-point scale)
- **No official status** in any country
- **Not recognized** as a minority language in Turkey
- Historically repressed and excluded from official education
- All Turoyo speakers are multilingual (also speaking Arabic, Kurdish, Turkish, or European languages)

## Preservation Efforts

| Initiative | Description |

| **Slomo Surayt II** | Advanced course (B level) by Prof. Dr. Shabo Talay, FU Berlin |
| **SouroyoTV** | Swedish diaspora TV channel broadcasting in Surayt and Suret |
| **oromoyo.ai** | AI-powered translation tool for Aramaic/Syriac varieties |
| **Weekend schools** | Community-run Turoyo classes in diaspora cities |

| **T-Lex** | Lexicon software used to compile standardized vocabulary |

## Lexical Composition

Based on the academic Swadesh list study (Barsky, Furman, Loesov 2018):

| Origin | Percentage | Examples |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Aramaic (native) | 72% | kalbo (dog), nuro (fire), maye (water) |
| Arabic loans | 13% | Various administrative and cultural terms |
| Kurdish loans | 8% | xezmat (service), local flora terms |
| Turkish loans | ~5% | Administrative terms |
| Other | ~2% | Modern loanwords |

## Key Facts for App Context

1. **Primary audience**: German-speaking Aramean diaspora (Suryoye community)
2. **Script priority**: Latin first, Serto optional/advanced
3. **Language of instruction**: German (primary), English (secondary)
4. **Cultural context**: Deeply tied to Syriac Orthodox/Catholic Christian identity
5. **Learning motivation**: Heritage language reconnection for 2nd/3rd generation diaspora
6. **Tone**: The language carries deep emotional weight -- it is the voice of a homeland most speakers have never seen
